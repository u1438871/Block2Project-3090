This contains a password strength checker used to check the strength of passwords. This is only for educational use.

This password strength checker is able to be run from the comman line / terminal. Or, download the python file into an IDE
and run it. You enter your password, and it gives you a score out of 10 for how strong it is.
This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information.
This tool is not accurate in assessing how strong a password is and does not guarentee anything. 
This tool is solely for the purpose of experimenting.
